## literal-table

Check literal in function descriptions.
Use table syntax.

**Note:**  
The literal marker '#|' has rudimentary detection for tables.
1. Any space before the first standalone '|' is trimmed when not in literal mode (using `#|`)
2. When a line starts with #| and ends with `|[ ]*$`,
the pipe from the literal marker `#|` will not be stripped.

Table with slight indention
| | literal | table |
| |  :---:  | :---: |
| | keep?   | yes   |

Indented, but not in literal mode
| literal | table |
|  :---:  | :---: |
| keep?   | yes   |

Directly at line start
|| literal | table |
||  :---:  | :---: |
|| keep?   | yes   |

Without duplicate left pipes
| literal | table |
|  :---:  | :---: |
| keep?   | yes   |
